				Hi! My name is Deva Palasingam. I graduated from UT Austin with an Electrical Engineering degree in 2015. I spent two years working as a hardware engineer. But now I'm working hard to make a switch to web development. It'll be hard, but I'm sure I'll have fun along the way.
			</p>
			
			<br>

			<p>
				A bit about me: My typical days these days are spent coding and learning about code. I also help out at my local church. I enjoy food for thought and thoughts of food. I like puzzles, brain teasers, and anything that makes me laugh.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				Here's some food for thought, recently featured by the good people of TED-Ed: Are we a body with a mind or a mind with a body? Be careful how you answer. 
			</p>	

			<br>
				
			<p>
				If we're a body with a mind, then our "mind" is nothing more than chemical reactions in our brain. Love, emotions, morality, even conciousness, all of those things are mere illusions. Fundamentally we are not really any different from a robot or even a rock, for that matter.
			</p>

			<br>	

			<p>
				If we're a mind with a body, then that mind must have a fully or partially non-physical existence. But then there must exist things that are non-physical, a spiritual realm if you don't mind me calling it that.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				Some follow up questions: Which do we intellectually believe? Which one seems more in alignment with our experience of reality? Do we live in a way that is logically consistent with the one we belive? What are the ramifications with regards to purpose, morality, and how we live our life?
			</p>
